		<h1>Hello,<br>
		I am Kamila &#x1F601;</h1>
		<img alt="Kamila BEKKAR" class="img-circle box-shadow-profile" src="images/kamila.jpg" width="220px">

		<p>Currently in my <strong>5th year at ESSEC Business School</strong>, I have had the opportunity to work for <strong>2 years in a digital marketing agency</strong>. Technology is a world that speaks to me and stimulates me, much like music... as you may have guessed, my dream is to work in <strong>digital music marketing</strong>.</p>


		<p>In the meantime, here's a page to discover a little more about me!</p>

			<h2>My Hobbies ‚öΩÔ∏è</h2>


			<p>I spend my time <strong>singing and listening</strong> to the latest released albums. Between two melodies, I <strong>kick the ball</strong> in what has been a passion for almost 15 years. I was supposed to become a professional player but as they all say, the cruciate ligaments... On the other hand, when I need to escape from this world, <strong>words are my friends</strong>. I spend entire days reading, immersed in a different universe.</p>


			<p>If I had to summarize this section in keywords? Let's say I live for <strong>music</strong>, <strong>football</strong>, and <strong>books</strong> !</p>
